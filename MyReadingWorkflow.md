 # My reading worklfow:
I read everyday.  I read for fun.  I read to pass the time.  But, most 
importantly I read to grow.  A few years ago I achieved a goal that 
surprised me.  I read 104 books in a year (To be fair, this was during 
the pandemic).  I felt like I had fun but I didn't learn as much as I 
thought I should have.  So for my first book in the new year I chose to 
read [How to Read a Book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/567610) 
by [Mortimer J. Adler](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mortimer-J-Adler).  
In his iconic book Adler teaches that reading is done on four levels: 
elementary, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical.  

What I took away in my first reading is that I was reading everything 
the same way, a very shallow elementary reading.  That is okay for some 
books but some books demanded more.  Undoubtedly, Francis Bacon said it 
best:
>"Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to 
be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; 
others to be read, but not curiously; and some few are to be read wholly, 
and with diligence and attention."

In this post I want to explain how I have incorporated Adler's lessons 
into my reading life.

Elementary reading...
If it is available I prefer to complete the first reading via an audiobook.  
I listen to the book while exercising or working around the house.  This 
way I can sneak in lots of books while finishing other tasks.

Inspectional reading...
If a deeper understanding of the book is warranted or there seems to be 
more value there, I will look for the #Kindle version on the 
[Libby App](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby).  This allows me to 
take my time with the text as well as highlight key passages, and insert 
notes. 

Analytical reading...
Adler prescribes that to be a demanding reader one must ask questions of 
the text.  My tool of choice to record, manage, and revisit my questions 
is #Readwise. #Readwise is a phenomenal tool for bookworms and casual readers 
alike.  It syncs with my kindle and allows me to review the highlights 
and notes and review them in a meaningful way.  (Readwise does a lot more, 
and check out their new #ReadwiseReader app as well.)

Syntopical...
Occasionally, there are books that I have connected with in such a way 
that I purchase a hard copy to add to my personal library so I can easily 
revisit them.  This allows me to compare notes across books that interests 
me and observe how each work ties in with a larger body of work in a field.  
#Readwise is also beneficial in this area as well.  But, the tool I use 
to help me track interests across many titles is #GoodReads.
